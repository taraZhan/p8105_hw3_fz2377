### Problem 1

``` r
total_aisles <- length(unique(instacart$aisle))
popular_aisles <- instacart |>
  group_by(aisle) |>
  summarise(item_count = n()) |>
  arrange(-item_count)
```

There are total of 134 aisles in this dataset, and “fresh vegetables”
aisle is the most items ordered from.

``` r
filtered_aisles <- instacart |>
  group_by(aisle) |>
  summarise(item_count = n()) |>
  filter(item_count > 10000) |>
  arrange(item_count)
ggplot(data = filtered_aisles, aes(x = aisle, y = item_count)) +
  geom_col() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  labs(title = "Items Ordered from Each Aisle",
       x = "Aisle",
       y = "Number of Items Ordered")
```

![](p8105_hw3_fz2377_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)<!-- -->
This plot displays the number of items ordered in each aisle that with
more than 10000 items ordered, among all, fresh fruits and fresh
vegetables have the most orders.

``` r
selected_aisles <- instacart |>
  filter(aisle == "baking ingredients" | aisle == "dog food care" | aisle == "packaged vegetables fruits") |>
  group_by(aisle, product_name) |>
  summarise(order_count = n(), .groups = "drop") |>
  arrange(aisle, -order_count) |>
  filter(min_rank(desc(order_count)) < 4)
kable(selected_aisles, 
      title = "Top 3 Items in Selected Aisles", 
      col.names = c("Aisle", "Product Name", "Order Count"))
```

| Aisle                      | Product Name         | Order Count |
|:---------------------------|:---------------------|------------:|
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach |        9784 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries  |        5546 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries  |        4966 |

This table shows the the number of times each item is ordered in three
most popular items from three aisles (“baking ingredients”, “dog food
care”, and “packaged vegetables fruits”).

``` r
selected_items <- instacart |>
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) |>
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) |>
  summarise(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day), .groups = "drop") |>
  pivot_wider(names_from = product_name, values_from = mean_hour) |>
  mutate(order_dow = factor(order_dow,
                            labels = c("Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday")))
selected_items |> 
  kable(format = "markdown", 
        col.names = c("Day of Week", "Pink Lady Apples (Mean Hour)", "Coffee Ice Cream (Mean Hour)"),
        title = "Mean Order Hour for Selected Items") 
```

| Day of Week | Pink Lady Apples (Mean Hour) | Coffee Ice Cream (Mean Hour) |
|:------------|-----------------------------:|-----------------------------:|
| Sunday      |                     13.77419 |                     13.44118 |

| Thursday    |                     15.21739 |                     11.55172 |
| Friday      |                     12.26316 |                     12.78431 |

This table shows the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples and
Coffee Ice Cream are ordered throughout a week.

States that observed at 7 or more locations in 2010

In 2002, PA, MA, NJ, CT, FL, NC (total of 6 states) were observed at 7
or more locations. In 2010, total of 14 states were observed at 7 or
more locations, including FL, NJ, TX, CA, MD, NC, NE, WA, MA, NY, OH,

```

![](p8105_hw3_fz2377_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)<!-- -->
This “spaghetti” plot contains only “Excellent” responses, years,
states, and the average values across locations within a state.

``` r
ny_data <- cleaned_brfss |>
  filter(locationabbr == "NY", year %in% c(2006, 2010))

  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "right")
```

![](p8105_hw3_fz2377_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)<!-- -->
This two-panel plot shows the distribution of ‘data_value’ for four
levels of responses in years 2006 and year 2010, among locations in NY
State only. Year 2010 has an overall high data values than year 2006 in
all responses.

### Problem 3

``` r
#Load, tidy, merge, organize datasets
covar <- read_csv("nhanes_covar.csv", skip = 4) |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  mutate(
      sex = recode(sex, "1" = "male", "2" = "female"),
      education = recode(education, "1" = "Less than high school", "2" = "High school equivalent", "3" = "More than high school")
      ) |>
  mutate(
    sex = factor(sex), 
    education = factor(education)
    )
clean_covar <- covar |>
  filter(age >= 21) |>
  drop_na()
accel <- read_csv("nhanes_accel.csv") |>
  janitor::clean_names() 
merged_data <- merge(clean_covar, accel, by = "seqn")
```

The “merged_data” dataset includes all variables from both ‘accel’ and
‘covar’ which merged by “SEQN” number; no data of participants less than
age of 21; no missing demographic data; and all numeric values changed
to meaningful factors.

``` r
#Table of the number of men and women in each education category
gender_edu <- merged_data |>
  group_by(sex, education) |>
  summarise(count = n(), .groups = "drop") |>
  pivot_wider(names_from = sex, values_from = count)
kable(gender_edu, 
      caption = "Number of men and women in each education levels",
      col.names = c("Education Level", "Number of Female", "Number of Male"))
```

| Education Level        | Number of Female | Number of Male |
|:-----------------------|-----------------:|---------------:|
| High school equivalent |               23 |             35 |
| Less than high school  |               28 |             27 |
| More than high school  |               59 |             56 |

Number of men and women in each education levels

``` r
#Visualization of Age Distribution
ggplot(merged_data, aes(x = education, y = age, fill = sex)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Age Distribution by Gender and Education",
       x = "Education Level",
       y = "Age") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

![](p8105_hw3_fz2377_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png)<!-- -->
The table shows there are more female in the higher education group,
more male have a high school equivalent background. This box-plot shows
the age distribution of men and women in three different education
levels. As a result, younger people appear to have a higher education
level (more than high school), the middle age group have relevant lower
education.

``` r
new_merged <- merged_data |>
  mutate(
    total_activity = rowSums(across(min1:min1440), na.rm = TRUE)
    )
ggplot(new_merged, aes(x = age, y = total_activity, color = sex)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .5) +
  facet_wrap(~education) +
  geom_smooth() +
  labs(title = "Total Activity by Age, Gender, and Education")
```

![](p8105_hw3_fz2377_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png)<!-- -->
This panel plot contains values of total activities as y-axis, and ages
as x-axis, It separates into three sub-plots by education levels to
compare men to women and their activities. As a result, there is a clear
relationship between age and activities, as people being older (around
60), their have less activities. The group with higher education level
apparent to have more activities and a gently line.

``` r
activity_data <- merged_data |>
  group_by(education, sex)|>
  summarise(across(starts_with("min"), ~ mean(.), .names = "mean_{.col}")) |>
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("mean_"), names_to = "time", values_to = "mean")|>
  mutate(
    time = substring(time, 9),
    time = as.numeric(time)
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'education'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

``` r
ggplot(activity_data, aes(x = time, y = mean, color = sex)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(. ~education) +
  labs(title = "24-Hour Activity by Education and Gender", 
       x = "Time in mins",
       y = "Mean value of activity")
```

![](p8105_hw3_fz2377_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png)<!-- -->
This three-panel plot shows the 24-hour activity time courses for three
education levels, and to find the relationship with gender. As a result,
in all three panels, female always have a higher mean value of activity
than male, the “less than high school” group shows a relevant high mean
value of activity than other education level groups.
